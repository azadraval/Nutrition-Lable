# Nutrition Label Project

This is my nutrition label project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built a detailed nutrition facts label similar to those found on food packaging using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The Nutrition Label project helped me learn how to create precise typography and styling for information-dense content. The label displays nutritional information in a format that follows FDA guidelines, demonstrating attention to detail and layout precision.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Working with typography and font styling
- Creating dividers and spacing elements
- Aligning text and values precisely
- Using CSS classes for consistent styling
- Implementing indentation and hierarchical information
- Adding custom Google Fonts
- Creating a realistic, standards-compliant design
- Structuring data in a clear, readable format

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure containing all the nutritional information
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the label to match FDA guidelines

## Design Elements

The nutrition label features:
- Bold headings and specific typography
- Properly aligned percentage values
- Various divider styles for visual separation
- Indentation for hierarchical information
- Precise spacing between elements
- Black and white color scheme for clarity
- Responsive sizing that maintains readability

This project was particularly interesting because it combined design precision with practical, real-world standards. I learned how typographical choices can dramatically affect the readability and usefulness of information-dense content.
